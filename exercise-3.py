# PART 1: Gather Information
#
# TODO: Gather information about the source of the error and paste your findings here. E.g.:
# - What is the expected vs. the actual output?
# actual: IndexError: list index out of range expected:[1,2,3,5,6] 
# - What error message (if any) is there?
# IndexError: list index out of range
# - What line number is causing the error?
# line 26
# - What can you deduce about the cause of the error?
# while loop logic does not work sends variable j negative to the point of the error


# PART 2: State Assumptions
#
# TODO: State your assumptions here or say them out loud to your partner ...
# Make sure to be SPECIFIC about what each of your assumptions is!
# HINT: It may help to draw a picture to clarify what your assumptions are.
# assuming j goes out of bounds in the while loop
